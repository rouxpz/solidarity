#Solidarity  

"Solidarity" is a sister project to ["Sluts Across America"](http://www.slutsacrossamerica.org), which launched in April 2012 and gathered approximately 9,000 submissions from birth control supporters around the world.  

The app takes a database of all of the responses gathered on "Sluts," puts them into a Markov chain generator, and creates a new response from the source text every time the page is refreshed.  It also posts each new response to the Twitter account [@SlutSolidarity](http://twitter.com/SlutSolidarity) as it is created.  

Written in Python using the Flask engine.  This app also uses [Adam Parrish's MarkovGenerator class](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet-examples).
